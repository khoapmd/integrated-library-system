## Setup

### Quick Setup (Windows)

1. Run the setup script:
```bash
setup.bat
```

2. Start the application (HTTP):
```bash
run.bat
```

3. For HTTPS testing:
```bash
run_https.bat
```

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize the database:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

3. Run the application:

**HTTP (default):**
```bash
python app.py
```
Access at: `http://localhost:5000`

**HTTPS (for testing):**
```bash
python app.py --https
```
Access at: `https://localhost:5000`

Note: For HTTPS, you'll need to accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser.

### SSL Certificates

The HTTPS functionality uses self-signed certificates for local testing:
- `cert.pem` - SSL certificate
- `key.pem` - Private key

These are automatically generated by `generate_ssl_certs.py` and are valid for 365 days for localhost and 127.0.0.1.

**Security Note:** The self-signed certificates are for development/testing only. For production use, obtain proper SSL certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority.
